# hw_sony Branch Info

## MK3: 1 III | 5 III | Pro-I (sony_extra-sagami REQUIRED)

Also, this branch may also have some specific commits like for example moving amplifier to it from the DT to hw_sony, so it's recommended to use the MK3-Core instead of the MK3 branch.

## MK3-Core: Any MK3 Device
Basically a clean branch without any required dependecies like the extra repo, this can be built as is, this is useful for devices like the 10 III.

## MK4: 1 IV | 5 IV
WIP Branch compatible with the MK4 series.
